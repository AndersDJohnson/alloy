Alloy
=====

Alloy is a new application framework by [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com) for [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform).

It provides a nice [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) framework for developers 
that are building Titanium apps.  

Current Status
--------------

*June 10, 2012* - _Unstable_


Goals
------

The following are the main goals for Alloy:

- *Productivity*: it's important that Titanium developers are productive and productive developers write less code. The main goal of Alloy is to provide a rapid framework for building robust applications.
- *Maintainability*:  it's important that Titanium apps can be maintained and sustained - not just by the original developer, but by others tha are on the team, that come along afterwards or by others in the Titanium community.  Alloy should provide a framework that anyone can drop into and become productive once they understand the basics of Alloy.
- *Best Practices*: it's important that Alloy provide a clean separation of concerns for application design, provide a framework that encapsulates the best practices for Titanium and provides a mechanism for reusable application building blocks called `Widgets`.

Installation
-------------

	npm install alloy

Credits
-------

Many credits should be noted in the development of Alloy.

- The Titanium community.  It's been a number of years and probably well over 50+ application frameworks that have been built around Titanium and we finally felt that it made sense for Appcelerator to work to build and support an official framework.  Thanks to everyone for their innovations, input and feedback.
- Jeff Haynie and Nolan Wright.  For their initial inspiration for Titanium and continued pushing to make it better. Codestrong.
- Kevin Whinnery.  For his passionate and persistent pushing to come up with a "standard way" and his many initial ideas.
- Russ McMahon. For his initial R&D work with Nolan to come up with the early versions and ideation and for leading the Alloy team.
- Tony Lukasavage.  For helping provide the JS ninja coding skills and for being on the Alloy team.
- Gabriel Tavridis. For helping provide the "herding of the engineering LOLcats" as the product manager for Alloy.
